ascii-hangman
=============

This is a simple but effective implementation of the classic word game
'Hangman' written in C, with only ASCII art. So it doesn't require any
special graphics libraries.


Requirements
------------

* Since it uses the `windows.h` file, it only runs on Windows at the
moment.
* This project was written in CodeBlocks. So you'll need CodeBlocks
IDE to build this project.


How to build the program
------------------------

Open `hangman.cbp` with CodeBlocks and simply build the project.

The executables must be stored in the `bin` directory.
